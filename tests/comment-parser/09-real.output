<p>Cool post !</p>

<p>I digged inside your (nice) code, and came<br>
out with another version using curl. The<br>
output name is always out.flv thought ...</p>

<p>What was interesting is to look at the server<br>
header with curl -i.<br>
First web page hit is apache, and the videos<br>
are served with lighttd, as they say in the<br>
google video explaining youtube guts.</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh

test $# -eq 1 || {
        echo "Usage: mytube.sh "
        exit 1
}
url=$1

# Get video ID.
video_url=`curl -s $url | awk '{ if (match($0, /"video_id": "([^"]+)".+"t": "([^"]+)"/, matches)) { print "video_id=" matches[1] "&t=" matches[2] } }'`

# Download video to output.flv
youtube=http://www.youtube.com
curl -L $youtube/get_video?$video_url -o out.flv
</pre>
