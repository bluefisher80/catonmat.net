Cool post !

I digged inside your (nice) code, and came
out with another version using curl. The
output name is always out.flv thought ...

What was interesting is to look at the server
header with curl -i.
First web page hit is apache, and the videos
are served with lighttd, as they say in the
google video explaining youtube guts.

<pre>
#!/bin/sh

test $# -eq 1 || {
        echo "Usage: mytube.sh "
        exit 1
}
url=$1

# Get video ID.
video_url=`curl -s $url | awk '{ if (match($0, /"video_id": "([^"]+)".+"t": "([^"]+)"/, matches)) { print "video_id=" matches[1] "&t=" matches[2] } }'`

# Download video to output.flv
youtube=http://www.youtube.com
curl -L $youtube/get_video?$video_url -o out.flv
</pre>
