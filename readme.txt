This is the new catonmat.net website.

I have around 100 ideas of what a modern, state of the art, personal website
should have.

I will explain all my ideas in an article series "Designing the new
catonmat.net together with me." I have all the ideas on 4 A4 sheets I'll scan
and digitalize them as I start writing the articles.

Update: I wrote more than 50 of them down in ideas.txt, take a look.

This readme.txt file will be updated as I go to reflect full history of making
the new catonmat.net

I am starting to push code today 2009.12.09.

The new catonmat.net is written in Python and reuses the following Python
modules (list is not complete):

    * Werkzeug   for WSGI and local development HTTP server.
    * SQLAlchemy for ORM.
    * Pygments   for parsing posts and syntax highlighting.
    * Mako       for HTML templates.
